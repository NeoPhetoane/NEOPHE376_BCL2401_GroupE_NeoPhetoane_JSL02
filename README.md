**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**
Creating a function : I am now able to use an HTML property in JavaScript and then use it in a function using querySelector.

Creating and calling an alert message: I was efficiently able to make the message pop up when there is a duplicate.

**Challenges Faced**
I struggled to manipulate CSS properties using JavaScript. I could not grapple how the theme changing button worked using toggle.

**Areas for Improvement**
Eventlisteners: I do not understand why event listeners are important when a function is called when certain conditions are used. The event listener of "click" seems not important when the function will still check when input is placed inside.

**Overall Learning Experience**
This was an interesting project to make. I found myself interested in the app itself and using the functions to control it. The alert property was the easiest and most interesting thing to use. It seemed too plain but had a greater purpose.
